## BUGs
sqlite bug: jupy*

section parsing in edit mode: table like ------------

tests fail when ~/.config/bkmr exists and has got wrong config (config tests)

fix markdown parsing and code highlighting





## Gotcha
bkmr search grad*  # expands to gradlew if present
edit with vim does not work when "sourcing" like: source <()>
skim requires TERM: export TERM=xterm-256color

## Marketing


## Advanced
doing column specific prefix search: find out schema: bkrm info --schema, b 'metadata:jq*' (metadata holds the title)
