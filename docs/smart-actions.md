# Smart Actions in bkmr

One of `bkmr`'s most powerful features is its context-aware action system. This system automatically determines the appropriate behavior for different content types, making your workflow more efficient.

## What Are Smart Actions?

Smart actions are the behaviors triggered when you "open" or interact with a bookmark. Instead of treating all content the same way, `bkmr` intelligently handles each item according to its type.

## Available Actions

| Action Type | Description | When Used |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Web Browser | Opens URLs in your default browser | URLs and web resources |
| Copy to Clipboard | Copies content for easy pasting | Code snippets and text documents |
| Shell Execution | Runs the content as a shell script | Shell commands and scripts |
| Markdown Rendering | Converts Markdown to HTML and displays | Documentation and notes |
| File Opening | Launches with appropriate application | Local files and directories |

## How Actions Are Resolved

When you execute `bkmr open` or select an item in the fuzzy finder, the action resolution process follows this sequence:

1. Check for system tags to identify the content type
2. Apply the corresponding action for that content type
3. Fall back to the default URI action if no specific type is detected

## Action Types in Detail

### URL/URI Action

This action opens web addresses in your default browser.

```bash
# Add a standard URL
bkmr add https://github.com github,code

# Open it (launches browser)
bkmr open 1
```

The URL action also incorporates template interpolation, allowing for dynamic URLs:

```bash
# Add a template URL with current date
bkmr add "https://reports.example.com/daily/{{ current_date | strftime('%Y-%m-%d') }}" reports,daily
```

### Snippet Action

The snippet action copies content to your clipboard, perfect for code fragments or commands you use regularly.

```bash
# Add a code snippet
bkmr add "function logDebug(msg) { console.log(`[DEBUG] ${msg}`); }" javascript,logging --type snip

# Open it (copies to clipboard)
bkmr open 2
```

Benefits for developers:
- No need to retype common code patterns
- Ensures consistency in code snippets
- Reduces errors from manual typing

### Shell Action

The shell action executes content as a shell script, making it perfect for automation tasks.

```bash
# Add a shell script
bkmr add "#!/bin/bash\necho 'Generating report...'\nls -la | grep '.log' > ~/report.txt" reports,logs --type shell

# Execute it (runs the script)
bkmr open 3
```

Benefits:
- Execute complex command sequences with a single action
- Store environment setup scripts for different projects
- Standardize common operational tasks

### Markdown Action

The Markdown action renders content to HTML and displays it in your browser, perfect for documentation and notes.

```bash
# Add markdown content
bkmr add "# Development Setup\n\n## Requirements\n- Node.js\n- Docker\n\n## Steps\n1. Clone repo\n2. Run npm install" 
     setup,dev --type md

# View it (renders in browser)
bkmr open 4
```

Benefits:
- Beautiful rendering of documentation
- Keeps technical notes accessible
- Works with template variables for dynamic content

### Text Action

The text action copies content to your clipboard, similar to snippets but intended for plain text.

```bash
# Add a text note
bkmr add "Meeting with client scheduled for Tuesday at 2pm to discuss project timeline." meetings,notes --type text

# Open it (copies to clipboard)
bkmr open 5
```

## Interactive Use with FZF

When using the fuzzy finder interface (`bkmr search --fzf`), actions are displayed in the preview panel and can be executed directly:

- `Enter`: Execute the default action for the selected bookmark
- `Ctrl-o`: Same as Enter, also records access
- `Ctrl-y`: Copy URL/content to clipboard
- `Ctrl-e`: Edit the selected bookmark
- `Ctrl-d`: Delete the selected bookmark

## Creating Custom Action Sequences

You can combine actions by creating shell scripts that operate on bookmark content:

```bash
# Add a shell script that uses another bookmark's content
bkmr add "#!/bin/bash\n# Get SQL query from bookmark ID 5 and run it\nquery=\$(bkmr open 5)\npsql -d mydb -c \"\$query\"" database,run --type shell
```

## Using Template Interpolation with Actions

All actions support template interpolation, allowing for powerful dynamic content:

```bash
# Markdown with dynamic date and user information
bkmr add "# Report: {{ current_date | strftime('%B %d, %Y') }}\n\nGenerated by: {{ \"whoami\" | shell }}" report,template --type md

# Shell script with environment variable
bkmr add "#!/bin/bash\ncd {{ env('PROJECT_DIR', '~/projects') }}\ngit pull" git,update --type shell
```

## Developer Workflow Benefits

The smart action system transforms how you work in the terminal:

1. **Reduced context switching** - Execute commands and access information without leaving your terminal
2. **Workflow automation** - Turn repetitive tasks into simple bookmark operations
3. **Documentation flow** - View rendered documentation when needed, copy code when required
4. **Consistent environment** - Use the same commands across different projects and contexts

## Tips for Effective Action Use

- **Tag thoughtfully** - Use descriptive tags to easily find the right action
- **Use system tags explicitly** - Add `--type shell` or similar to ensure the correct action
- **Combine with templates** - Make your actions dynamic with template variables
- **Create task-specific collections** - Group related actions with common tags
